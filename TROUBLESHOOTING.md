# White Screen Issue - Fixes Applied

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. Missing Environment Variables
**Problem**: The app was failing to load because Supabase environment variables were not configured.
**Fix**: 
- Created `.env` file with placeholder values
- Modified `supabase.ts` to use fallback values instead of throwing errors
- Updated `authStore.ts` to gracefully handle missing Supabase configuration

### 2. Asset Import Errors
**Problem**: The Dashboard component was trying to import images from public directory as modules.
**Fix**: 
- Removed `import mainLogo from '../../public/images/mainlogo.png'`
- Changed to use public path: `src="/images/mainlogo.png"`

### 3. Authentication Initialization Blocking
**Problem**: The app was showing loading screen indefinitely when auth couldn't initialize.
**Fix**: 
- Modified `App.tsx` to skip loading screen in development mode
- Added graceful fallback when Supabase is not properly configured

## Files Modified:
1. `/frontend/.env` - Added environment variables
2. `/frontend/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Added fallback configuration
3. `/frontend/src/store/authStore.ts` - Added graceful error handling
4. `/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Fixed image import
5. `/frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added development mode handling

## Next Steps:

### To Complete Setup:
1. **Get Supabase Credentials**:
   - Go to https://supabase.com
   - Create a new project or use existing one
   - Get your Project URL and anon key from Settings > API
   - Replace placeholders in `.env` file

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key
   ```

3. **Test the Application**:
   - The app should now load without white screen
   - Authentication features will work once Supabase is properly configured
   - All other features should work normally

### If You Still See White Screen:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for any errors
3. Check the Network tab for failed requests
4. Ensure the server is running on http://localhost:5173

## Current Status:
✅ App loads without white screen
✅ Basic routing works
✅ Homepage should be visible
⚠️ Authentication disabled until Supabase is configured
⚠️ Some image warnings may appear (non-critical)

The application should now be working and displaying the homepage instead of a white screen.
